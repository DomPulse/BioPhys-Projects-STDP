This was trained with STDP
The output strength of each neuron was "normalized"
That is, the sum of the output weights of each neuron added together was some set value
They could never be negative
The total was 10*number of exitatory neurons
So the average output weight of a given neuron was 10 pA (units?)
The resulting output has very clear difference in firing rates between category 1 to categories 2 and 3
Categories 2 and 3 are mostly the same, cannot see a clear difference

Limitiations are 3 fold
The inability to clasify categories 2 vs 3
The majority of exitatory neurons almost never fire
The input to exitatory weights trend toward extreme values
